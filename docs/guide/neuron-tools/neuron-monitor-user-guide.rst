User Guide for Neuron Monitor *(BETA)*
======================================

WARNING: This tool is currently in "Beta". Metric organization and
naming might change during the Beta period.

--------------

**neuron-monitor** collects metrics and stats from the Neuron runtimes
running on the system and streams the collected data to ``stdout`` in
``JSON`` format.

These metrics and stats are organized into **metric groups** which can
be configured by providing a configuration file as described in `Using
neuron-monitor <#using-neuron-monitor>`__.

When running, **neuron-monitor** will:

-  Collect the data for the metric groups which, based on the elapsed
   time since their last update, need to be updated
-  Take the newly collected data and consolidate it into a large report
-  Serialize that report to JSON and stream it to stdout from where it
   can be consumed by other tools - an example of such a tool is
   provided in the form of the `neuron-monitor Cloudwatch
   example <#companion-scripts>`__ and is installed in
   ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py``
-  Wait until at least one **metric group** needs to be collected and
   repeat this flow

Using neuron-monitor
--------------------

neuron-monitor takes the following 2 optional arguments:

::

   --verbose= Verbosity level (default: 0)
    -c, --config-file= Path to configuration file

-  ``--verbose Verbosity level``, where **Verbosity level** can be 0 to
   4, controls the amount of debugging and verbose information sent to
   stderr; **0: no output**, **4: maximum verbosity**, default is 0

-  ``-c, --config-file path``, where **path** is a valid path to a
   neuron-monitor JSON configuration file

Example:

::

   neuron-monitor -c monitor.conf

Not specifying any option will enable collecting all the metric groups
with a period of 5 seconds.

Example of a configuration file which enables all available **metric
groups** for a single runtime with a global update period of 1 second
and sets an update period of 2 seconds for the ``"hw_counters"`` metric
group:

::

   {
     "period": "1s",
     "neuron_runtimes": [
       {
         "address": "unix:/run/neuron.sock",
         "metrics": [
           {
             "type": "nc_counters"
           },
           {
             "type": "memory_used"
           },
           {
             "type": "runtime_cpu_usage"
           },
           {
             "type": "inference_stats"
           },
           {
             "period": "2s",
             "type": "hw_counters"
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "system_metrics": [
       {
         "type": "cpu_usage"
       }
     ]
   }

JSON objects and fields in the settings file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``"neuron_runtimes"`` - array of objects specifying which Neuron
   runtimes to monitor and what metric groups are enabled for each
   runtime

   -  ``"address"`` - address of this runtime
   -  ``"metrics"`` - array of objects specifying which metric groups to
      capture for this runtime

      -  ``"type"`` - type of metric group

-  ``"period"`` - this field applies to **metric group** objects and
   sets the amount of time between two updates for that metric group

   -  if can be specified as part of the **root** and/or
      **neuron_runtime** objects where it applies to all their children,
      and/or as part of a **metric group** object
   -  if there's no period specified, a default value of **5 seconds**
      will be used

-  ``"system_metrics"`` - array of objects specifying which system level
   metric groups are enabled

Runtime-level metric groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `"nc_counters" <#nc_counters>`__ - NeuronCore related metrics
-  `"memory_used" <#memory_used>`__ - data on the amount of memory used
   by the Neuron runtime
-  `"runtime_cpu_usage" <#runtime_cpu_usage>`__ - Neuron runtime vCPU
   utilization data
-  `"inference_stats" <#inference_stats>`__ - runtime-wide inference
   stats, including error count and latency
-  `"hw_counters" <#hw_counters>`__ - counters for correctable and
   uncorrectable memory ecc events

System-wide metric groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `"cpu_usage" <#cpu_usage>`__ - system-wide vCPU usage

Execution model
---------------

|image|

neuron-monitor waits for one or more **metric groups** to be up for
update, then collects the corresponding data, consolidates it into a
report which is streamed to stdout as a JSON and goes back to waiting.

The JSON output format
----------------------

Whenever the report gets updated, a complete JSON is written to stdout.
This is its structure:

::

   {
     "runtime_data": [
       {
         "runtime_index": 0,
         "error": "",
         "report": {
           "nc_counters": {
               [...]
           },
           "inference_stats": {
               [...]
           },
           "memory_used": {
               [...]
           },
           "hw_counters": {
               [...]
           },
           "runtime_cpu_usage": {
               [...]
           }
         }
       }
     ],
     "system_data": {
       "cpu_usage": {
               [...]
       }
     },
     "instance_data": {
       "instance_id": "i-0011223344556677a",
       "instance_type": "inf1.xlarge",
       "ami_id": "ami-0011223344556677b"
     }
   }

-  ``"runtime_data"`` is an array containing one entry per each runtime
   specified in the settings file

   -  ``"runtime_index"`` is the zero-based index of this runtime in the
      configuration file
   -  ``"error"`` specifies any error that occurred when collecting data
      from this runtime
   -  ``"report"`` will contain the results for the runtime-level metric
      groups; their formats are described below

-  ``"system_data"`` is similar to ``"runtime_data"``\ â€˜s ``"report"``
   but only contains system-level metric groups (not associated to any
   runtime)

There is also instance information added to the root object regardless
of the configuration:

::

     "instance_data": {
       "instance_id": "i-0011223344556677a",
       "instance_type": "inf1.xlarge",
       "ami_id": "ami-0011223344556677b"
     }

Each **metric group** requested in the settings file will get an entry
in the resulting output. The general format for such an entry is:

::

   "metric_group": {
     "period": 1.015, // Actual captured period, in seconds
     "error": "",     // Error, if any occurred, otherwise an empty string
     [...]            // Metric group specific data
   }

-  each vCPU usage object contains the following fields:

   -  ``"user"`` - percentage of time spent in user code
   -  ``"nice"`` - percentage of time spent executing niced user code
   -  ``"system"`` - percentage of time spent executing kernel code
   -  ``"idle"`` - percentage of time spent idle
   -  ``"io_wait"`` - percentage of time spent waiting for IO operations
   -  ``"irq"`` - percentage of time spent servicing hardware interrupts
   -  ``"soft_irq"`` - percentage of time spent servicing software
      interrupts

-  ``"average_usage"`` - contains the average usage across all vCPUs
   during the captured period
-  ``"usage_data"`` - contains per vCPU usage during the captured period
-  ``"context_switch_count"`` - contains the number of vCPU context
   switches during the captured period
-  ``"error"`` - string containing any error that occurred when
   collecting the data

Companion scripts
-----------------

neuron-monitor is installed with one example Python companion script:
**neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py**. It requires Python3 and the `boto3
Python
module <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#quickstart>`__.
It is installed to:
``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py``.

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py --namespace <namespace> --region <region>

For example:

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py --namespace neuron_monitor_test --region us-west-2

Whenever the runtime is unreachable for one update (for example, it was
restarting) or there is an error posting to Cloudwatch, the script will
output an error message to stderr. It will continue outputting a message
to stderr for each failure on each update. You can capture these
messages to a file or redirect them to ``/dev/null``.

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py --namespace neuron_monitor_test --region us-west-2 2> monitor_cloudwatch_err.txt

Customizing the companion script:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The companion script was kept simple so it can be easy to customize.
Each runtime metric group has a handler function which receives the data
from the monitor as an argument. For example:

::

   def process_nc_counters(instance_info, rt_index, data):
       metrics = []
       common_dims = create_common_dims(instance_info, rt_index)
       for nc_idx, nc_data in data['neuron_cores'].items():
           dims = [create_dim('NeuronCore', nc_idx)]
           metrics.append(create_metric('MatmulUtilization', nc_data['matmul_utilization'],
                                        'Percent', dims + common_dims))
       return metrics

The ``data`` argument will contain the ``"nc_counters"`` data for the
runtime with the index ``rt_index`` as described
`here <#nc_counters>`__. You can add new dimensions by expanding the
``dims`` array, add new metrics by adding to the ``metrics`` array or
rename any item. By changing the ``create_common_dims`` function you can
control what dimensions are assigned to all the metrics.

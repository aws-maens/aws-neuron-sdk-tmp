Getting started
---------------

Neuron SDK's documentation provide the information needed to enable you start developing and deploying your ML inference application, depending if you are a first time user or if you are looking for spcific topic documenattion, this section provide you with "Getting Started" information you need to quickly navigate your way into your Neuron ML application. 

First time user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a first-time-user of Neuron, the following steps are recommended for you to get started with Neuron:

#. Run your first Neuron ML application by following the instructions in one of the following Getting Started tutorials to get familiar with Neuron develeopment flow of your ML framework of prefrence:

   * :ref:`tensorflow-resnet50`
   * :ref:`pytorch-restent50`
   * :ref:`mxnet-resnet50`


#. Get familiar with Neuron fundamentals and tools:

   * Learn :ref:`neuron-fundamentals` : such as :ref:`neuron-data-types`, :ref:`neuron-batching` and :ref:`neuroncore-pipeline`, learning Neuron fundenetals will help you utilize Neuron to develop a highly optimized ML application.

   * Get familiar with :ref:`neuron-cc`,:ref:`neuron-runtime` and :ref:`neuron-tools` by going over the overview sections and briefly reading about the supported features and capabilities of Neuron Compiler,Runtime and Tools.


#. Deploy Neuron ML application at scale by learning how to tune, optimize and deploy your ML application at scale by following the instructions of one of the HowTo guides at :ref:`deploy-ml-application`.

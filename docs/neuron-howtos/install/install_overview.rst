Overview
========

To use Neuron you can use a pre-built Amazon Machine Images (DLAMI) or
DL containers or install Neuron software on your own instances. To
ensure you have the latest Neuron version we recommend to either install
it on your own instance, or to check for the installed version when
using DLAMI or DL containers.

You can :ref:`neuron-install-guide` if you already have an environment
you'd like to continue using.
